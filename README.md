# term-search
Given a list of terms (terms can be multiple words) find all locations of occurrences in a document

## Usage

To run the basic example, see `doc` and `terms` in `trie.py`. This module takes a list of `terms` and determines the start and end location of the matched term in `doc`. The main module execution `python3 trie.py` currently just prints out a list of matches and their locations from the hardcoded doc and terms.


## TLDR

Run the following for output:

`python3 trie.py`
